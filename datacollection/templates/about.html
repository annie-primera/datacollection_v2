    <h1>About this study</h1>

    <h3>What is the purpose of this research?</h3>

    <p>Through the implementation of <a href="https://prowritingaid.com" target="_blank">ProWritingAid</a> into ESL classrooms,
        I am trying to answer the following questions: </p>

        <ul>
            <li>How can software technologies like AWE help to support the process of self-regulated learning in ESL students? </li>
            <li>How do ESL students engage with the feedback provided by AWE programs to create their own learning? </li>
            <li>Does using AWE programs help ESL students become more proficient English writers?</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>How will data be collected from me?</h3>

    <p>Every time you interact with the program, data is recorded automatically. The following data will be collected:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Time spent using the platform</li>
        <li>Functions used </li>
        <li>Feedback uptake </li>
        <li>Submitted text</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You might be randomly selected for an interview at the end of the workshop. If this happens, I will be
        recording the interview as audio with no images.</p>

    <h3>What will be done with the data? Will it be kept confidential?</h3>

    <p>The data will be analysed quantitatively and qualitatively. I want to look at how you use the feedback,
        whether it helps you engage with your texts and whether it allows you to improve the quality of your writing. </p>

    <p>All the data will be anonymised, so it is impossible to trace back to the original student.
        Only a numbered ID will identify each studentâ€™s work, but the keys to those ID numbers will be stored in an encrypted file.
        All data collected will be stored in an encrypted form as well.
    </p>

    <h3>Will the results be shared? </h3>

    <p>Excerpts from the data may be shared with my PhD supervisors, but as stated above, all identifying information will be erased from them and they will be anonymised. </p>

    <p>The results will be used as part of my doctoral thesis, and I may publish a paper based on this research.
        If the research is published, anonymity will be respected as stated in the previous section. </p>

    <p>If you have any questions about this project, either now or in the future, please contact me at <a href="mailto:ana.hibert@ed.ac.uk">ana.hibert@ed.ac.uk.</a> </p>
